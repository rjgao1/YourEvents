# YourEvents

An event recommendation website based on geolocaiton and user favorite history. 

Current simple implementation of the recommendation system is content-based. I plan to implement an item-based one in the 
near future. 

I also plan to migrate from MySQL to MongoDB soon. 

Deployed on Amazon Web Services EC2. Website is live here: http://18.218.81.235/YourEvents  
Web service is run in the Apache Tomcat server environment
